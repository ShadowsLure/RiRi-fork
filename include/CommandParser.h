// So, why not std::function?

// Originally, commands were stored using std::function and lambdas in a string-to-function map.
// However, profiling showed that it introduces overhead due to:
// 
//  - I do not know how, but potential heap allocations (likely from type erasure or dynamic storage).
//  - Type erasure logic (polymorphism essentially, we don't need that)
//  - Larger Objects because std::function is typical 32+ bytes.
//
// Since we do NOT need capturing lambdas (although they are cool), and we are mostly working
// with global/static functions, we are using function pointers instead.
//
// Metrics:
// Iterations   std::function   function pointer    % Difference
// 1 million    137.191 ms      134.613 ms          ~1.88% faster
// 1.4 billion  202,236 ms      189,615 ms          ~6.2% faster
//
// Sure, this isn't a deal-breaking change â€” I don't expect RiRi to deal with 1.4 billion commands.
// But the difference is clear. Plus, since we are not capturing lambdas memory usage is expected
// to be lower.

// Expected? Where are the metrics?
// I wasn't able to benchmark the memory usage due to the limited number of commands and lack of
// its code/logic cleanup. So, as soon as the command parser is ready, I will add the metrics for
// memory usage as well.
//
// Compiler Used: Clang++
// NOTE: The profiling was done with all optimisation enabled ("-O3", "-flto", "-march=native"
// and "-fuse-ld=lld") to simulate real world usage. Additionally, these metrics are without the
// use of `std::string_view` as I have yet to implement it properly.
//
// Loosely inspired by how Redis dispatches commands via raw function pointers in C.

// Also TODO: After getting the updated metrics, move it to readme.
